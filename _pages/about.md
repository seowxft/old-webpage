## Bio
* I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Psychology at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, supervised by [Dr Claire Gillan](https://gillanlab.com/)
* My research interests lie in understanding the role of decision making and metacognition in mental health using transdiagnostic, dimensional approaches with web-based and in-lab behavioural, neuroimaging and computational methods.
* Specifically, I investigate the role of metacognition in compulsivity, a subcomponent of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that has transdiagnostic relevance, aiming to extend our understanding of goal-directed behaviour is compromised in high compulsive individuals.
