* I obtained my Ph.D. at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, supervised by [Dr Claire Gillan](https://gillanlab.com/).
* My research interests lie in understanding the role of <strong>decision making</strong> and <strong>metacognition</strong> in mental health using <strong>transdiagnostic, dimensional approaches</strong> with web-based and in-lab behavioural, neuroimaging and computational methods.
* Specifically, I investigate the role of metacognition in compulsivity, a subcomponent of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that has transdiagnostic relevance, aiming to extend our understanding of how goal-directed behaviour is compromised in high compulsive individuals.
