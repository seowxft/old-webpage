<strong>The next phase of computational psychiatry: broader applications and novel methods</strong>
<i>Chairs:</i> Dr Oliver Robinson, Dr Alexandra Pike

Computational psychiatry is a burgeoning field which uses techniques from computational neuroscience and applies them to problems in mental health research. This symposium focuses on research that embarks on the next phases of computational psychiatry as we start to move away from simply mapping differences between diagnostic groups. Specifically, this symposium explores: 1) how we can leverage the computational approach to combine data across the growing number of studies; 2) start to explore transdiagnostic differences across anxiety and autism; 3) combine the computational approach with EEG to explore the temporal dynamics of computational parameters; and 4) use computational modelling to understand the effects of pharmacological agents.
