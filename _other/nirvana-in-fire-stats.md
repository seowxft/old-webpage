In total, N = 17 works were excluded, leaving N = 879 for analysis.

<strong>Fig 1.</strong> The earliest fanwork recorded on AO3 is [Could have, Would have, Should have by <strong>Sychronergy</strong>](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5148068), published on 5th Nov 2015. The largest number of submissions of fanwork were in December, in 2017 (N = 68), 2019 (N = 59) and 2018 (N = 54). This is likely due to NiF Exchange and Yuletide events.
